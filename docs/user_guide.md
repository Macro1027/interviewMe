# User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Project user guide. This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the system.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure your environment variables (see Configuration section)

### Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in your API keys and other sensitive information
3. Adjust settings in `config/settings.yaml` as needed

## Features

### Natural Language Processing

The system includes powerful NLP capabilities powered by transformer models.

#### Example Usage

```python
from src.ai.nlp import TextAnalyzer

analyzer = TextAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze("I really enjoyed this experience!")
print(results.sentiment)  # Positive: 0.92
```

### Speech Recognition

The speech recognition system can convert spoken language into text with high accuracy.

#### Example Usage

```python
from src.ai.speech_recognition import SpeechTranscriber

transcriber = SpeechTranscriber()
transcript = transcriber.transcribe("audio_file.mp3")
print(transcript.text)
```

### Emotion Analysis

The emotion analysis system can detect emotions in text or speech.

#### Example Usage

```python
from src.ai.emotion_analysis import EmotionDetector

detector = EmotionDetector()
emotions = detector.analyze("I'm so excited about this project!")
print(emotions.primary)  # happy
```

### Voice Synthesis

Convert text to natural-sounding speech.

#### Example Usage

```python
from src.ai.voice_synthesis import TextToSpeech

tts = TextToSpeech()
audio_file = tts.synthesize("Hello world!", voice="en-US-Neural2-F")
audio_file.save("hello.mp3")
```

## API Access

For integration with other systems, use our REST API.

```bash
# Example API call
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/nlp/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Sample text for analysis", "analysis_type": "sentiment"}'
```

See the [API Documentation](API.md) for detailed information about all available endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure your API key is valid and correctly set in the environment variables

2. **Model Loading Errors**
   - Check that you have sufficient disk space for the model files
   - Verify that your GPU drivers are up to date (if using GPU acceleration)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Consider using a smaller model variant for faster processing
   - For batch processing, increase the batch size in `config/model_config.json`
