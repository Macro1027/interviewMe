# Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment

This document describes the CI/CD pipelines set up for the AI Interview Simulation Platform.

## Overview

We use GitHub Actions as our primary CI/CD platform. Our workflows automate testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure code quality and a smooth release process.

## Workflow Architecture

![CI/CD Pipeline](docs/images/cicd_pipeline.png)

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **Testing Workflow**: Runs on every code change to validate quality
2. **Deployment Workflow**: Handles deployments to staging and production
3. **Maintenance Workflow**: Performs routine maintenance tasks

## Testing Strategy

We follow a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components 
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user journeys
- **Security Tests**: Scan for security vulnerabilities
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations

All tests are run as part of our CI pipeline to catch issues early.

## Environments

We maintain several environments:

- **Development**: Local development environment
- **Staging**: For testing before production deployment
- **Production**: Live environment serving end users

Each environment has appropriate access controls and security measures.

## Deployment Process

Our deployment process follows these steps:

1. **Build**: Create deployment artifacts
2. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment
3. **Smoke Tests**: Validate basic functionality
4. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production environment

Production deployments are triggered by version tags and require manual approval.

## Release Strategy

We follow a semantic versioning approach:

- **Major version** (x.0.0): Significant changes with potential breaking changes
- **Minor version** (0.x.0): New features with backward compatibility
- **Patch version** (0.0.x): Bug fixes and minor improvements

Each release is properly tagged and documented in our changelog.

## Monitoring and Metrics

Our CI/CD pipelines collect and track:

- Test coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Build times
- Deployment success rates

## Secrets Management

Sensitive information is stored as GitHub Secrets and accessed securely by workflows.

Required secrets:
- Cloud provider credentials
- API keys
- Service tokens

## Detailed Documentation

For detailed information about each workflow, refer to the [workflows documentation](.github/workflows/README.md).

## Best Practices

- Always write tests for new features
- Keep PR size small and focused
- Review CI results carefully
- Follow the branching strategy
- Only merge code that passes all tests

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CI/CD pipelines:

1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Ensure all required secrets are configured
3. Verify that your changes meet project code standards
4. Check if infrastructure or dependencies have changed
